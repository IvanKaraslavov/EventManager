# EventManager
Event Manager â€“ Ivan Karaslavov
<br>
Setup:
In order to setup the application, you have to run the .exe file located in EventManager\bin\Debug\EventManager.exe. A new window should open with the application itself. The application will not run if a SQL Server is not installed on the current computer.
If the application throws exception that means that there is not a SQL Server installed on the current computer.
If a SQL Server is installed but the program still throws exception and is not working, please install SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) located in the .zip file.
Use:
The program is pretty self-descriptive. The program is an Event Manager used for adding, deleting and updating an event.
The first four buttons are used for navigation through the existing events.
-- Add a new event
In order to add a new event, you have to click the Add new button and the Save and Cancel buttons will be unlocked. The text boxes will clear so you can write the name and location of your event and set start and end time. You can save the changes with the Save button or cancel them with the Cancel button.
-- Edit an event
If you want to edit a current event, you can make the changes and then click the Update button. If you want to delete it, you can do it with the Delete button.
On the right there is a drop-down menu with the names of all events. If you want to find the additional information of an event, you can do it by selecting it. The text boxes and date-time pickers will be filled with the information you need.
